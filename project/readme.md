That’s a solid project plan! Here’s a rough outline of how you could structure it:

1. Registration and Login System
Database: Create a users table with fields for id, name, email, and password (hashed).
Registration Form: Create a form for users to sign up.
Login Form: Create a login form to authenticate users.
Session Management: Use PHP sessions to manage user logins.
2. Questionnaire Submission
Database: Create a table for submissions with fields for id, user_id, response_data (for questionnaire answers), and a file upload field.
Submission Form: Create a form for users to submit their responses and upload files.
File Handling: Handle file uploads securely, ensuring file types and sizes are validated.
3. Display Responses
Query Submissions: Fetch submission data from the database.
Display Table: Create a page that displays a table of names and submission dates.
4. Instructor Response Submission
Database: Create an instructors table (if needed) and a responses table for instructor submissions.
Instructor Form: Create a form for instructors to submit responses.
Review System: Allow viewers to access and review instructor responses.
Additional Considerations:
Validation: Ensure to validate inputs for both registration/login and questionnaire responses.
Security: Implement security measures like prepared statements to protect against SQL injection, and consider using HTTPS for data transmission.
UI/UX: Think about the user interface to make it user-friendly.
Next Steps:
Set up a local development environment with PHP and a database (like MySQL).
Start building the registration and login system first, then proceed to the other features.
